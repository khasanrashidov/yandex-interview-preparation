Additional Tips for Interview Preparation:
For each question, your friend should be able to:

Explain the approach before coding
Handle edge cases (null inputs, empty arrays, etc.)
Discuss time and space complexity
Provide real-world use cases
Explain related concepts (closures, event loop, etc.)

Common follow-up questions:

"How would you test this function?"
"What are the performance implications?"
"How does this relate to browser APIs?"
"Can you optimize this further?"

Study resources:

Practice each problem multiple times
Understand the underlying concepts, not just memorize solutions
Be ready to explain WHY you chose a particular approach
Practice writing clean, readable code with good variable names
